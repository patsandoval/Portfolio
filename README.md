# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you'll find a showcase of my projects and experiences in mobile app development and backend development.

## Mobile App Development

During my college days, I developed several mobile applications using Android Studio and Unity. These projects were built using Java and C#, demonstrating my proficiency in both languages and my ability to create functional and engaging mobile experiences.

### Projects

#### Coralz: An Interactive Mobile Application for People with Alzheimer's
- **Technologies Used**: Android Studio, Java
- **Description**: The "Coralz: An Interactive Mobile Application for People with Alzheimer's" is developed as a support tool for Alzheimer's patients to improve their memory and brain function experience such as; cognitive exercise, problem solving, and brain training like puzzles, in the form interactive games, journal, and voice recorder. This mobile application was developed as part of college's capstone project.

#### Erudition: Physical Science Mobile Game-Based Learning
- **Technologies Used**: Unity, C#
- **Description**: This project, developed for the college project "Erudition: Physical Science mobile game-based learning," involved creating interactive game modules. I took charge of developing two modules: 

1. **Free Fall Game**: A thrilling game where players guide a frog through the sky, avoiding obstacles such as saws and birds until safely reaching the bottom.
   
2. **Platformer Game**: In this game, players complete levels by navigating platforms, avoiding obstacles, and monitoring their distance and speed.

#### Book World
- **Technologies Used**: Android Studio, Java
- **Description**: This project was developed for a college project. "Book World" is an Android application designed to provide users with a comprehensive library experience. Users can browse through a variety of books categorized by genres such as fiction, non-fiction, science fiction, etc. Each book listing includes a brief summary and information about the author. Users can download books in PDF format directly to their devices for offline reading. The app also features a search function to help users find specific books quickly and efficiently.
